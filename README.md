JBehave BuDDy is a desktop application that helps you write story files. It 
provides a graphical interface for creating, editing, and formatting stories.

JBehave BuDDy:

* validates your steps syntax and highlights keywords, making it harder to
introduce difficult-to-debug errors

* generates examples, allowing you to see all possible cases based on the 
parameters in the scenario, and to keep only the ones you care about

* neatly and correctly formats your story file output

JBehave BuDDy is written for the Java platform. It is distributed as an .exe 
file for Windows systems, and as an executable jar file for all other operating
systems supporting a JVM. Java 1.5 or later is required.
